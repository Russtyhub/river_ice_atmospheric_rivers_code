# Influence of Atmospheric Rivers on Alaskan River Ice

This is a repository for storing my analysis and subsequent paper on the relationship between Alaskan river ice breakup timing and atmospheric river activity.

Atmospheric rivers (ARs) transport vast amounts of moisture from low to high latitude regions. One region particularly impacted by ARs is Interior Alaska (AK). We analyze the impact of ARs on the annual river ice breakup date for 26 locations in AK. We investigate the AR-driven rise in local air temperatures and explore the relationship between ARs and precipitation, including extremes and interannual variability. We found that AR events lead to an increase in local air temperatures for over one week (by ≈ 1 °C). ARs account for 40% of total precipitation, explain 47% of precipitation variability, and make up 59% of extreme precipitation events, each year. By estimating the heat transfer between winter precipitation and the river ice surface, we conclude that increased precipitation during the coldest period of the year delays river ice breakup dates, while precipitation occurring close to the breakup date has little impact on breakup timing.

The river ice breakup dates for each site were collected from the [Alaska-Pacific River Forecast Center](https://www.weather.gov/aprfc/); the daily meteorological data at a 1km by 1km spatial resolution were imported from Daymet using the [Daymet pixel extraction tool](https://daymet.ornl.gov/single-pixel/) maintained by Oak Ridge National Laboratory; atmospheric river detection is based on
version 3 of the tARget algorithm ([Guan & Waliser, 2019]( https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD031205); [Guan, 2022](https://doi.org/10.25346/S6/YO15ON)).
