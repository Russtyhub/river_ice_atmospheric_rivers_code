# Influence of Atmospheric Rivers on Alaskan River Ice

This is a repository for storing my analysis and subsequent paper on the relationship between Alaskan river ice breakup timing and atmospheric river activity.

Although the primary focus is on the impact that atmospheric rivers have on Alaskan river ice breakup timing, this analysis  ultimately finds that any high precipitation, event whether local or caused by an atmospheric river, can delay the breakup timing. In addition, this analysis looks at the impact that atmospheric rivers have on the local temperature and precipitation seen at the  various sites collected throughout interior Alaska USA. 

The river ice breakup dates for each site were collected from the [Alaska-Pacific River Forecast Center](https://www.weather.gov/aprfc/); the daily meteorological data at a 1km by 1km spatial resolution were imported from Daymet using the [Daymet pixel extraction tool](https://daymet.ornl.gov/single-pixel/) maintained by Oak Ridge National Laboratory; atmospheric river detection is based on
version 3 of the tARget algorithm ([Guan & Waliser, 2019]( https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD031205); [Guan, 2022](https://doi.org/10.25346/S6/YO15ON)).
