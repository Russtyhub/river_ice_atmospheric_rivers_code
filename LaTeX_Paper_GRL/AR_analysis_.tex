	Atmospheric rivers (ARs) transport vast amounts of moisture 
	from low to high latitude regions. One region particularly 
	impacted by ARs is Interior Alaska (AK). We analyze the impact

	in AK. We investigate the AR-driven rise in local air temperatures

	for up to one week. Interannually, ARs account 
	for 36\% of total precipitation, explain 48\% of precipitation 
	variability, and make up 57\% of extreme precipitation events. 
	By estimating the heat transfer between winter precipitation
	and the river ice surface, we 
	conclude that heavy precipitation events (HPEs) during the

\section*{Plain language summary}

	Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are large storm systems originating in
	tropical regions capable of depositing large amounts of
	precipitation in high latitude regions. 
	Using river ice breakup data recorded throughout Interior
	Alaska (AK) we set out to explore the relationship between
	ARs and annual river ice breakup timing from 1980 to 2023. 
	We found that 
	daily air temperature increases can last up to
	one week after an AR event. Interannually, ARs
	account for 36\% of total precipitation, 
	explain 48\% of the variability of precipitation, and make up 57\% 
	of extreme precipitation events. We then
	calculated the total heat transfer between precipitation 
	and the river ice surface. We used the mass and temperature 
	of precipitation accumulated onto the river ice surface to approximate 
	thermal energy exchange. The magnitude of energy exchange was then
	correlated to the river ice breakup timing. We found that heavy 
	precipitation events (HPEs)
	from both local precipitation and ARs occuring relatively close to
	river ice breakup dates, have little correlation to the breakup
	date. However, HPEs that occur during the coldest period of the
	year (typically late December to early February) are strongly inversely
	correlated with river ice breakup timing and therefore delay
	the breakup date.

\section{Introduction}

Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow corridors of intense water vapor
transport that significantly influence hydrologic events, transporting
most of the water vapor outside of the Tropics \cite{AR_def}.
It is estimated that ARs are responsible for as much as 90\% of poleward
water vapor transport at midlatitudes \cite{other_alg}. ARs contribute to
extreme precipitation events across various regions worldwide 
\cite{Espinoza2018, Massoud2019}, including
Western North America \cite{Dettinger2004, Neiman2008, Guan2010,
ARs_flood_WA_State, ARs_flood_Russian_River_CA, Ralph2013, ARs_CA}
Europe \cite{Lavers2013, ARs_impact_Norway}, the Middle East \cite{massoud2020, 
Lashkari2020,  Esfandiari2024}, and Western South America
\cite{ARs_impact_SA}. In recent years, the impacts of ARs on the cryosphere
such as Greenland \cite{Mattingly2018} and Antarctica \cite{Gorodetskaya2014, 
Wille2021}, have been more extensively analyzed. 

In recent years, a growing number of works 
investigating the relationship between ARs and 
high latitude regions have been undertaken. Evidence shows that between
1981 and 2020, higher atmospheric moisture content was significantly correlated
with lower sea ice coverage over almost the entire Arctic Ocean
\cite{ARs_lead_to_sea_ice_loss}. For those same years, another analysis
found that 100\% of extreme temperature events in the Arctic (above 0
$\degree C$) coincide with the presence of ARs \cite{Ma2023}. Analyses have noted
a relationship between frequent AR activity and sea ice loss, caused by
increased rainfall from moisture originating in lower latitudes
\cite{Zhang2023, maclennan_contribution_2022}. However Arctic systems
are complicated, as the intense moisture transport within ARs can also
result in heavy snowfall events, thus contributing to the accumulation
of snowpack, especially in mountainous regions \cite{Saavedra2020,
Guan2010}. Under the right conditions, this relationship has been found
to actually increase the mass balance of glaciers \cite{Little2019}.
\cite{Little2019} found ARs to be the primary drivers of both highest
ablation and snowfall events, substantially impacting glacier mass
balance at Brewster Glacier in New Zealand. 
Understanding the role of ARs in the cryosphere is essential for
assessing their broader impact on regional water resources and glacier
dynamics in a changing climate. 

While a number of works have explored
the relationship between ARs and sea ice, glaciers, and ice sheets, 
to our knowledge there has
been no study that investigates the relationship between ARs and Arctic
river ice. Past studies have used physics based processes
to model the annual breakup timing and conditions of Arctic river ice
\cite{Paily, ashton1986river, Prowse_Bonsal_Duguay_Lacroix_2007,
jasek1998, shen_newest}. Through such studies, it is recognized that an 
increase in precipitation leads to an increase in
streamflow, altering the hydraulics associated with river ice breakup, and 
potentially accelerating mechanical breakup events \cite{ashton1986river}.
It has also been proposed that increased snow pack as a result of increased 
precipitation contributes to breakup severity \cite{Prowes2002}. Using 
breakup records throughout Interior Alaska (AK) from the Alaska 
Pacific River Forecast Center Database
(the same breakup records used in this analysis) \citeA{Bieniek2011} determined 
that winter precipitation plays a relatively minor role in impacting the 
breakup timing of river ice and if anything accelerates the breakup timing as a 
result of increased streamflow. They also report that 
increased storm activity in the spring leads to increased surface air 
temperature, leading to earlier breakup dates \cite{Bieniek2011}. However, 
their analysis used only 4 sites (as opposed to the 25 used in this analysis) 
and aggregated precipitation seasonally, without accounting for the interaction 
between winter precipitation and temperature that occurs at a finer temporal
resolution. 

Our analysis aims to answer the following questions: 
1.) Since ARs have been known to impact Arctic systems by increasing 
temperatures, is there a change in
air temperature in different regions of AK corresponding to the 
presence of ARs?
2.) How do ARs contribute to precipitation throughout AK, 
considering how ARs impact total annual precipitation, interannual 
variability, and extreme events?
3.) How do ARs impact the timing of river ice breakup, does the presence 
of ARs accelerate or delay the timing of river ice breakup?

\section{Data}

\subsection{AR Catalog}

Similar to previous studies, we define ARs using integrated vapor
transport (IVT) values constructed from 6-hourly values of 3‐D wind and
water vapor at eight pressure levels between 300 and 1,000
mb from the National Center for Environmental Protection (NCEP) 
reanalysis data product \cite{NCEP_NCAR_reanalysis}. 
AR detection is based on the third version of the tARget algorithm
\cite{Guan_Waliser2019, bin2022}.
\citeA{alg_for_detecting_AR_moisture_fluxes} developed a global
AR detection algorithm, which was updated and validated later with
dropsonde data \cite{guan2018}. This algorithm is employed for
our study, which is based on a combination of IVT magnitude,
direction, and geometry characteristics, to objectively identify ARs.
Contiguous regions of enhanced IVT transport are first identified from
magnitude thresholding (i.e., grid cells above the seasonally
and locally dependent $85^{\text{th}}$ percentile, or 
$\mathrm{100\frac{kg}{m*s}}$, 
whichever is greater) and further filtered
using directional and geometry criteria requirements. Although the 
$\mathrm{100\frac{kg}{m*s}}$ threshold is applied globally, it is intended for 
dry (including polar) regions since in other regions the $85^{\text{th}}$ percentile 
is already larger than $\mathrm{100\frac{kg}{m*s}}$. The detection
algorithm was applied to NCEP in its native resolution of $2.5 \degree$.
This detection algorithm had over 90\% agreement in detecting AR
landfall dates when compared with other AR detection methods for Western
North America \cite{Neiman2008}, the United Kingdom \cite{Lavers2011}, 
and East Antarctica \cite{Gorodetskaya2014}. 

\subsection{Daymet Daily Surface Weather and Climatological Summaries}

Precipitation and daily
minimum and maximum temperatures ($T_{\text{min}}$ and $T_{\text{max}}$ respectively) 
from Oak Ridge National
Laboratory's Daymet 1kmx1km daily product were used, via the
Distributed Active Archive Center \cite{daymet}. Daymet precipitation, 
$T_{\text{min}}$ and $T_{\text{max}}$, were used in our analysis as they
have a strong agreement with NCEP temperature outputs for our 
region of interest
Figure \ref{fig:maps_crooked_creek}C. Additionally, 
because Daymet is derived directly from in situ instruments 
and meteorological stations, it represents a robust 
dataset for precipitation and temperature predictions across North
America \cite{daymet2021}. This dataset has been a standard for validation 
among several analyses related to arctic regions \cite{Diro2019, 
Akinsanola2024}. The annual mean precipitation and 
temperature for the year 2021 over the AK region are shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:maps_crooked_creek}AB, and 
Figure \ref{fig:maps_crooked_creek}C 
shows the temperature profiles, precipitation and AR trends
for one of those location over one year (Crooked 
Creek at the Kuskokwim River in 2021).

	date for the Kuskokwim River in 2021 for Crooked Creek.}
\label{fig:maps_crooked_creek} 
\end{figure}

\subsection{River ice breakup records}

River ice breakup dates 
were obtained from the Alaska Pacific River Forecast Center database.
While exact coordinates were unavailable, locations 
were estimated based on proximity to weather stations and airports, to 
maintain spatial consistency with inputs used in Daymet’s meteorological 
models. There were 25 locations (shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:maps_crooked_creek}A and \ref{fig:maps_crooked_creek}B) 
identified as having at least 35 breakup 
records between 1980 and 2023 (the current temporal availability of 
Daymet), although breakup records go as far back as 1896 for some 
locations. The 35 breakup records threshold was used because it 
allowed for the greatest 
number of locations with the most complete time series 
necessary for statistical analysis. There is always one breakup 
date per year, but not every year has a recorded date, so some 
years are represented as empty values in the dataset. On average, 
recorded break up dates range from mid March to late 
June. This dataset has been used in other analyses such as 
\cite{murphy2022, Brown2018, Bieniek2011}. As an example, 
the breakup date for Crooked Creek 
at the Kuskokwim River in 2021 occurred in early May and
is depicted in Figure 
\ref{fig:maps_crooked_creek}C with a 
vertical purple dashed line.



\section{Methods}

To assess the influence of ARs on local temperature, we analyze 
the relationship between the presence of an AR and the temperature 
change at a specific location. The presence of an AR is represented 
numerically as a binary value indicating whether or not an AR is 
active on a particular date. We then estimate how many days this 
change in temperature lasts. To do this, we used a
varying temporal window combined with a pairwise t-test. 
For each
AR occurrence in the dataset, a lookback window and forecast 
window each equal to \emph{n}
days in length was created before and after the AR date, respectively,
whereby: $ n \in \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 14\}$.
For values of \emph{n} greater than one day the mean was 
taken within each window
for $T_{\text{min}}$ and $T_{\text{max}}$. These averaged 
temperatures were then
calculated over all locations. Mean temperature pairs 
were assessed using a one tailed pairwise t-test to check
whether ARs increase the local temperature over period of 
time \emph{n} $(\alpha =
0.05)$. For example, if $\emph{n} = 3$ assessing $T_{\text{min}}$,
then the mean of $T_{\text{min}}$ three days prior to each AR event
will be compared to the mean of $T_{\text{min}}$ for
the three days post each AR event.


We explored how ARs contribute to precipitation, by
separating AR-based precipitation from the total amount. We 
then used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test \cite{Rey2011} to test 
the hypothesis 
that AR events tend to produce more precipitation than other
precipitation events. We opted to use a non-parametric 
test (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) 
because the distributions of precipitation were shown to
not be normal after log transformation using the
Shapiro-Wilks test \cite{shapiro_wilk_test}. We also estimated
the interannual variability of precipitation that ARs account for by
conducting a univariate ordinary least squares regression (OLS). 
For extremes, we extracted the top 5\% of precipitation events and determined 
what fraction of those events are associated with ARs. 

To determine the impact that ARs have on river ice breakup timing, 
we estimate the heat transfer between the river ice (we are assuming
a layer of ice on top of the Arctic rivers) and 
the precipitation settling on the surface, 
using Equation \ref{eq:heat_transport}:

\begin{equation}
q = \rho \cdot m \cdot \Delta T 
	\label{eq:heat_transport}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $q$ is heat flux ($\mathrm{\frac{J}{m^2}}$); 
$\rho$ the specific heat 
of the precipitation (assumed to be either water or 
snow depending on the temperature)
($\mathrm{\frac{J}{kg \degree C}}$); $\Delta T$ is the difference between 
the temperature of the precipitation which is approximated 
using $T_{\text{min}}$ as a proxy, and the river ice surface which is
assumed to be $\mathrm{0\degree C}$ ($\mathrm{\degree C}$); $m$ 
the mass of the precipitation per unit area ($\mathrm{\frac{kg}{m^{2}}}$). 
The integral of these values
over all precipitation events that occurred six months prior to the
breakup date is taken with respect to time. A temporal bias function
(Equation \ref{eq:cases})
with tunable parameters is applied to the heat transfer equation to assess 
the days of the year in which  precipitation events were more 
impactful on breakup timing:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:cases}
	f(t; \gamma, \kappa, DOY, c) =
	\begin{cases}
    	\frac{e^{-\gamma \cdot (-t - DOY)} - 1}{\kappa} & \text{if }
        	t < c \\
    	\frac{e^{-\gamma \cdot (t - DOY)} - 1}{\kappa} & \text{if }
        	t \geq c \\
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\gamma$ is a tunable parameter impacting the width of
the exponential function; \emph{t} is time in days; 
\emph{DOY} is the Gregorian day of year
that the breakup date occurred; \emph{c} is a tunable parameter dictating the
center placement of the function; $\kappa$ is a normalizing constant.
Finally, Equation \ref{eq:final_eq} solves for $Q_{\text{year, location}}$,
the total thermal 
energy exchange for a given location, for a given breakup year.
Equation \ref{eq:final_eq} is tuned over the entire 
hyperparameter search space for each
location and each breakup year, optimized by selecting the 
parameter values that produce 
the Pearson correlation coefficient with the greatest absolute value. 
 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:final_eq}
	Q_{\text{year, location}} = \int_{t_i}^{t_{DOY}} \left(f(t; \gamma, \kappa, DOY, c) \cdot
	q\right) \, dt
\end{equation}



\section{Results} 

\subsection{AR impact on temperature}

We applied the pairwise t-test comparing lookback and forecast 
windows of length \emph{n} for all locations. Figures
\ref{fig:large}A and \ref{fig:large}B show the change in p-values for each
value of \emph{n} where the dashed lines represent the mean p-value over 
the study area and the color transition signifies the interquartile range (IQR). 
For example, looking at $T_{\text{min}}$ (\ref{fig:large}A), 
the light blue represents the $\mathrm{25^{th}}$ to the 
$\mathrm{75^{th}}$ percentile or IQR of p-values, while the blue-grey is 
the $\mathrm{75^{th}}$ 
percentile to the maximum p-value given \emph{n}. Same is true for the 
color transition of $T_{\text{max}}$ in Figure \ref{fig:large}B. 
Figure \ref{fig:large}C and \ref{fig:large}D shows the mean increase 
in temperature from the lookback window to the forecast window 
given \emph{n}. The mean
temperature increase tends to be higher for $T_{\text{min}}$ post AR than  
$T_{\text{max}}$, with both plots
showing a clear downward trend as the length of \emph{n} 
increases. We found that there is a
statistically significant difference in $T_{\text{min}}$ 
(based on an $\alpha = 0.05$) roughly 8 days before and after 
an AR event. 
This was true for all locations in the study as represented 
by the fill plot (Figure \ref{fig:large}A). 
This increase in 
temperature can be as high as 1.5 $\mathrm{\degree C}$ ($n=2$) (Figure 
\ref{fig:large}C). The t-test for
 $T_{\text{max}}$ implies that the presence of an AR can increase 
 temperatures for roughly 6 days on average (Figure 
 \ref{fig:large}B), with an increase as high 
 as 0.75 $\mathrm{\degree C}$ ($n={3, 4}$) (Figure 
 \ref{fig:large}D).

\end{figure}

\subsection{AR impact on precipitation}

Figures \ref{fig:large}E and \ref{fig:large}F show the monthly IVT from 
AR events and monthly total precipitation through the span of the 
data record, aggregated over all locations, respectively. Figure \ref{fig:large}G
shows the proportion of precipitation accounted for by ARs over time, where 
light blue depicts the IQR of proportions and blue-grey represents 
proportions outside of the IQR, over all 25 locations. The dashed line 
represents the mean proportion.
ARs tend to account for 36\% of
precipitation on average (Figure \ref{fig:large}G), 
with a high degree of variability given
the year and location. In 2005 and 2020 for example, ARs accounted for nearly 
80\% of the total precipitation in some locations. The results 
from the Wilcoxon rank-sum test show that
precipitation from ARs tends to be greater in magnitude than non-AR 
precipitation
($\text{test statistic} = -83.85; \text{ p-value} \approx 0.0)$. In addition, it
was found that of the top 5\% of high precipitation events (HPEs), 57\% were
caused by ARs (Figure \ref{fig:large}H).
Correlating annual aggregated precipitation from ARs, to total annual
aggregated precipitation in a univariate OLS, we find that the
coefficient of determination ($\mathrm{R^{2}}$) is equal to 0.48 (Figure 
\ref{fig:large}I). This indicates that ARs
explain about 48\% of interannual variability in precipitation, 
over all 25 locations.

\subsection{Transfer of energy based on Precipitation}

To estimate the impact HPEs have on river ice breakup dates, we use 
Equation \ref{eq:final_eq} to calculate the heat transfer
between precipitation and the river ice surface. This 
exercise allows us to separately take the energy input from 
local precipitation, 
precipitation via ARs and total precipitation, 
and determine whether or not that integrated 
energy accelerates or decelerates the breakup of river ice. 
We find that there is a strong negative correlation between the heat 
transfer and the \emph{DOY} 
in which the river ice breaks (Figure
\ref{fig:concatenated_corr_plots}A). In this context, negative values 
along the y-axis of Figures \ref{fig:concatenated_corr_plots}A and 
\ref{fig:concatenated_corr_plots}D 
are interpreted
as a negative heat exchange, meaning a cooling effect on the river ice
surface or the depositing of precipitation below freezing along the 
river ice surface. This is optimized for 
when the temporally-weighted bias curve
is positioned during the coldest period of the year - typically between
late November and early February (Figure \ref{fig:concatenated_corr_plots}C).
In other words, the presence of HPEs of greater magnitude, occuring 
on colder days of the 
year, show a strong inverse correlation in breakup timing. 
For example, Crooked Creek on the Kuskokwim River has a
clear negative trend, with HPEs causing a cooling effect on the
river ice surface, delaying the \emph{DOY}. This relationship has a Pearson 
correlation
coefficient $ (r_{p} )=$ -0.84 and a Spearman correlation coefficient
$(r_{s}) =$ -0.80 (Figure \ref{fig:concatenated_corr_plots}A). 
The relationship between the total
number of ARs that occurred six months prior to the breakup date and the
\emph{DOY} are shown on the center column 
(Figure \ref{fig:concatenated_corr_plots}B and 
\ref{fig:concatenated_corr_plots}E; 
these two plots are the same by
definition) indicating that the number of AR 
events that occur within the six months prior to the breakup
is insufficient information 
in correlating to breakup timing on its own. The
bottom row of Figure \ref{fig:concatenated_corr_plots} shows that the
use of a bias function (Equation \ref{eq:cases}) is necessary, as simply 
applying the integral of Equation \ref{eq:heat_transport} using an 
equally weighted temporal bias function (the aggregated total heat 
transfer) is uncorrelated. 
Table \ref{tab:pearson} shows the correlation for each location, after
tuning parameters \emph{c} and $\gamma$ are applied to Equation 
\ref{eq:final_eq}.
Table \ref{tab:pearson} also shows the center of the bias curve \emph{c} 
(month-day)
that was selected for, at each location, given the integrand for 
precipitation used in
Equation \ref{eq:final_eq} (ie. Total Precipitation, Precipitation from ARs, 
Precipitation not from ARs).

\section{Conclusion and Discussion}

This study investigated the impact atmospheric rivers (ARs) and heavy precipitation events
(HPEs) have on the breakup dates of 
river ice in Alaska. We explored the relationship of ARs to temperature increases throughout 
the study domain, the contribution of ARs to various precipitation metrics, 
including variability and extremes, and determined the impact of ARs and HPEs on the \emph{DOY} 
in which the ice on the surface of Alaskan rivers eventually breaks. 

For temperature increases, we found that ARs generally lead to a week-long persistent 
increase in daily temperature over Alaska, with temperatures rising by as much as 1.5°C 
for $T_{\text{min}}$ and 0.75°C for $T_{\text{max}}$. This result makes sense, as noted 
by many past works showing how warm moisture brought on by ARs can warm the cryosphere
\cite{Wille2021, Ma2023, ARs_lead_to_sea_ice_loss, Zhang2023}. For the contribution to 
precipitation, our results show that ARs account for a significant portion of precipitation 
in Alaska, contributing to 36\% of total precipitation by volume on 
average. They also explain 48\% 
of interannual variability and make up 57\% of extreme precipitation events 
(precipitation events within the top 5\% of deposition). These results are
consistent 
with past works, such as \citeA{Nash2024} which showed that throughout Southeast Alaska
as few as 6 annual ARs can account for 68\% - 91\% of precipitation days. As for 
the relationship between ARs and river ice breakup, we show evidence that intense ARs
occurring during the coldest period of the year appear to delay the annual breakup 
date of river ice. Our results do not show that ARs are unique relative to local forms of 
precipitation in this regard (Table \ref{tab:pearson}) with no evidence that increased 
precipitation events of any kind closer to the breakup date accelerates the breakup date.
This is likely attributed to a combination of the heat transfer from precipitation, 
as well as changes in the river ice surface as a result of snowfall. Increased snow coverage
will increase the albedo of the river surface, as well as insulate it, mitigating temperature 
fluctuations during the coldest period of the year. It should be noted that a major caveat of
our analysis is the assumption that the river ice surface temperature is held constant at
$\mathrm{0\degree C}$ and that air temperature is a perfect proxy for precipitation. We were unable to 
find a complete dataset on river ice surface temperatures for the locations and time 
period of our study. However, we assume that the mass of liquid, snow or ice deposited on 
the river surface, times its temperature, will be a sufficient indicator of the heat
exchanged in the system - a process that becomes far more difficult to model when the 
structure of accumulated snow is taken into consdieration near $\mathrm{0\degree C}$.   

Overall, understanding the role of ARs and other HPEs in the
timing of river ice break up in Alaska is 
crucial for predicting and managing the impacts of climate change in the region, 
especially since studies have shown that AR frequency and intensity in this region are 
expected to increase in a warmer world \cite{Espinoza2018, Massoud2019}. The findings 
suggest that ARs contribute significantly to the hydrology and climate of Alaska, 
affecting temperature, precipitation, and river ice dynamics. Further research in this 
area could help improve our understanding of ARs and their role in shaping the climate 
of high-latitude regions.
